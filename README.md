# Python Visualization Tutorial
## SETUP
Navigate to Google Colab → https://colab.research.google.com

+ Google Colaboratory is a Jupyter notebook environment hosted on Google’s cloud services, and thus easily integrated into Google Drive.  
+ Like Jupyter environments, Colab runs using “cells” that consist of either Python code or text in a markup language called Markdown. Cells build off each other and must be run in order of occurrence, but can be run separately to debug or organize.  
+ Helpful shortcuts:
  + **Run cell and select next cell**: shift + enter
  + **Run cell and add new cell after**: alt + enter
  + **Undo last action (inside a cell)**: ctrl + m + z
  + **Find and replace**: ctrl + m + h
  + **Insert code cell above**: ctrl + m + a
  + **Insert code cell below**: ctrl + m + b
  + **Delete cell**: ctrl + m + d

Create a new notebook. Name it whatever.

## CODE
LIBRARIES:
+ **numpy**: library primarily used to perform mathematical operations on arrays and matrices.
+ **matplotlib**: library for plotting data⁠—static, animated, or interactive.
+ **pandas**: library for data manipulation (sorting, filtering, etc.) and analysis.
+ **seaborn:** library for data visualization based off of matplotlib and works well with pandas.
